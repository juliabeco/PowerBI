HR Analytics Recruitment Analysis
[LINK to project:](https://github.com/juliabeco/PowerBI)  
Description: Created a Power BI report to analyze a recruitment process, converting a flat file into a star schema model. The report includes metrics such as the shortlisting percentage vs. total applicants, detailed drill-through features, and various DAX measures for advanced analysis. Interactive slicers and charts highlight key recruitment insights to assist in data-driven decision-making. The project emphasizes the advantages of a star schema over a single-table model for enhanced performance and scalability.
